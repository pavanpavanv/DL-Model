Human Emotion Classification using Deep Learning and CNN 

Human Emotion Classification using Deep Learning and CNN involves training convolutional 
neural networks (CNNs) to recognize and categorize emotions from facial expressions. The 
process starts with collecting a diverse dataset of facial images labeled with different emotions 
(e.g., happy, disgust, fear, pain, sad, anger). The CNN model extracts features from these 
images, learns patterns, and classifies them into predefined emotional categories. Deep learning 
techniques enhance accuracy by automatically identifying intricate patterns in the data. This 
approach has applications in fields like healthcare, entertainment, human-computer interaction, 
and security, enabling machines to better understand and respond to human emotions in real
time. 

Dataset Description: 
 
The dataset for Human Emotion Classification contains 1,184 facial images categorized into 
six distinct emotion labels: anger, disgust, fear, happy, pain, and sad. Each image captures 
subtle facial expressions that reflect these emotional states. The dataset is designed to include 
diverse faces with variations in age, gender, and ethnicity to improve the model's robustness. 
Images are pre-processed to have consistent dimensions, ensuring they are suitable for training 
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This dataset is balanced to provide adequate 
representation of each emotion class, facilitating the model's ability to learn and distinguish the 
unique features associated with different emotions.
