Human Emotion Classification using Deep Learning and CNN 

Human Emotion Classification using Deep Learning and CNN involves training convolutional 
neural networks (CNNs) to recognize and categorize emotions from facial expressions. The 
process starts with collecting a diverse dataset of facial images labeled with different emotions 
(e.g., happy, disgust, fear, pain, sad, anger). The CNN model extracts features from these 
images, learns patterns, and classifies them into predefined emotional categories. Deep learning 
techniques enhance accuracy by automatically identifying intricate patterns in the data. This 
approach has applications in fields like healthcare, entertainment, human-computer interaction, 
and security, enabling machines to better understand and respond to human emotions in real
time.
